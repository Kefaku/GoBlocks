# GoBlocks
This is a project designed to make coding and making games in Minecraft much easier for beginners. Using in-game blocks and items, you can use a block based coding system to create experiences.

Inspired by Scratch, which is a popular block coding program. This brings it into a more practical environment and can be used in Minecraft to create fun games or systems.

- **Player Event**: This runs blocks placed after it when a player does a certain action, in this case when they first join the game
- **Player Action**: This does something to a player (for example, give them an item, move them). In this case, it sends a message. In the barrel above this, you can place a __Text Value__ containing text which specifies what text to send
